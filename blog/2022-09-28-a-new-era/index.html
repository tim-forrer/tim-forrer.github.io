Not in the sense that I feel a great loss, but in the sense of the magnitude of change that people in the UK will be experiencing now. In some sense it marks a sort of loss of identity for myself. Having been away from home during such a seismic event, I sort of feel this is a real milestone in my departure from experiencing life through the lens of a ‘British’ person. Instead of experiencing this event, I observed it from afar, as every other person outside of the UK has done, and now I feel a separation between myself and the ‘general British consciousness’, whatever that might mean.</p> <p>I’ve always said I never really felt like a British person, and that feeling (naturally) seems to be getting ever more acute.</p> <h2 id="new-prime-minister">New prime minister</h2> <p>And the new eras don’t stop there this September.</p> <p>The UK in addition to a new monarch also got a new PM in Liz Truss, who recieved a whopping(!) 81,326 votes to win the Tory leadership election. I don’t have much of a clue about politics beyond a sound-bite here or there I’ll be the first to admit, but I find it crazy that the next PM can be decided by such a small minority of the UK public, it doesn’t seem to really be in keeping with the democratic nature of our politics.</p> <p>Whilst I doubt that many would vote for their constituencies majority favourite, I do feel like it should have been left up to the conservative MPs to decide the new leader, since at least they have been voted to represent a larger base of UK voters. But whatever, fine, ok, maybe it’s not in keeping with the rules of the 1922 committee or some other group to do that.</p> <p>Surely though being elected as PM in such a fashion, with such a small minority of votes, it cannot then be possible to bring in such mega sweeping changes to the UK economy in a ‘mini’-budget?</p> <p>It just seems absurd to me.</p> <p>Again, I’ll be the first to admit I’m no economic expert (maybe I should stop really commenting on things I’m no expert on…), but it seems blatently obvious to me that measures such as the abolition of the 45% higher rate of income tax will only serve to help those who are more well off. And surely such a seismic shift should be accompanied by a forecast by an independent body, especially in light of the fact that there is so little electoral support for the current government?</p> <p>Clearly not it would seem.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p> <p>So, now if an massive international agency of the UN tells you that they would ‘not recommend large and untargeted fiscal packages’ and that ‘the nature of the UK measures will likely increase inequality’,<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> will such an undemocratically elected government then take time to re-evaluate its approach?</p> <p>I would hope so but I do not hold my breath.</p> <h2 id="new-coach">New coach</h2> <p>In perhaps what was unsurprisingly not the biggest news story on the day of the Queen’s death, Chelsea head coach Thomas Tuchel was sacked and replaced by the now former Brighton and Hove Albion manager, Graham Potter.</p> <p>I’m in two minds personally about this change. I think Thomas Tuchel did deserve better. He led us to a Champion’s League trophy and steadied the ship during a tumultuous (to say the least) second half of the season, including two other finals that technically we didn’t lose (didn’t really do much to try and win though either). But I didn’t believe that he was really the right person to lead Chelsea through the ‘long term project’ that so many of us fans desire. His style of football was never overly inspirational nor entertaining, even if he did get wins, and I think during the rough patches there really wasn’t anything much to cheer about. For a long term project, I think you have to keep the fans entertained at the very least so that they keep the faith through trying times. So maybe this was the right decision for the future of the club if a long term project is what we really want.</p> <p>Although I’ll be the first to admit… well, you get the idea by now.</p> <p>In truth the person I feel most sorry for is Billy Gilmour - sold to BHFC to get gametime under a coach renowned for developing talent, only to have that coach move to the very club who just sold you 7 days later.</p> <p>In any case, I’m looking forward in incoming influx of Harry Potter jokes on Reddit, and I’m hoping that we’ll be able to look back on the Graham Potter era fondly and say:</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UpRIetBN5UI?start=43" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> <h2 id="other-bits-and-bobs">Other bits and bobs</h2> <p>It was Shinzo Abe’s state funeral yesterday and there was a marked increase in police presence on our walk into Shibuya yesterday evening which was interesting. I guess that the route his urn was taking might have been due to follow the same roads that we were walking along.</p> <p>Anyway I tried to get a few pictures and managed one that I was reasonably happy with. Sadly I didn’t get the focus right, but I was rushing because I’m not really sure what the protocol is when taking photos on such an occasion. I’m sure it’s probably fine to take photos of the police, but then again my mum always did drive into me a deep fear of authority.</p> <p>Til the next.</p> <p><img src="/assets/photos/police_hanamasa_bridge.JPG" alt="police_at_hanamasa_bridge"></p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"> <p>https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62970803 <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote"> <p>https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63051702 <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p> </li> </ol> </div> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="sticky-bottom mt-5"> <div class="container"> © Copyright 2023 tim forrer.
