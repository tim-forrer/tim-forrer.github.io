I finally saw a monkey!

Just the one though :(

Went with the badminton club to a spring training camp in 群馬(Gunma), which was about 2.5 hours drive north of Tokyo.
Tbh I was a bit unsure about how it might be, especially since we had been randomly drawn into rooms of 3 and Shimada scared me.
Rui Lan said I should take it as a chance to get to know him better, and maybe he wouldn't be so scary afterwards - which kinda worked out, in that he's not *as* scary as before (but I'm still not sure I'd chose to be in a room with him).

Whilst I didn't necessarily become closer to people I wasn't already friendly with, the people who I was friendly with I think it was good in that spending this kind of time together (I was going to say 'outside of training' but that wouldn't necessarily be very accurate, given that we were training all day from 9-5), they see me less as an older PhD student and more as someone who also enjoys playing badminton, so it was definitely time well spent.

I also had the joy of a conference submission deadline coincide with this camp but thankfully I was able to get most of it done it advance, and what I couldn't I had the great help of my co-authors to finish off for me - one of whom is also somehow managing to finish his PhD thesis at the same time as guiding me through the quagmire that is categorical quantum mechanics.
Fingers crossed that we'll get a submission approved.

Anyways, as can be inferred from the recent lack of activity, I think I'll keep posts a bit shorter from now on, given that the PhD life is really starting to hit hard now.

Only thing left to say is that I'm so sad I didn't try harder to get a good picture of the monkey...
Here's the photo I did get anyways.
