As I approach the one year mark of being in Japan, and with the start of my doctoral programme looming, I thought that it might be a good time to further inflict my presence on the world.

This website has been purposed as a blogging website purely because Github pages is free and this seems to be the easiest way to setup a website on here. Sometimes I think it would be fun to write a blog but honestly I'm not sure I have enough content going on in my life, nor enough interesting thoughts to really merit it.

So what is this website then? Well mainly I've made it because every researcher seems to have their own website so it seems silly not to have one also. I've found that not treading the path oft-walked leads to getting mauled by a bear.

I also often come across personally useful things, like programming tricks or somesuch, that are buried deep on the interwebs, or just on websites with too much other content to make it easy to scroll through and find (for SEO or something I guess). So I'll probably post those kinds of things from time to time just to make my life easier when trying to find stuff again.

The final purpose of this website is for people who I've (in some sense) left behind in the UK. It would do them a great injustice I think to say that no-one cares about what's going on in my day-to-day life. And I write that with no sense of ego, but in fact immense gratitude to have such great friends. As time goes by I find it's becoming increasingly difficult to find time to catchup and chat. I often find myself thinking that perhaps I could, and should, be making a greater effort towards reciprocating the efforts that other's have made towards me. So I hope that for them, this does serve as some kind of effort. And I'd like them to know how grateful I am to still be able to count upon them, no matter how many miles might separate us.
