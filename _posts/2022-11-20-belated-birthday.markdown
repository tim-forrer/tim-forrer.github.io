I'm 24 now. How delightful. I'm sure you will be suitably cheered by this one, as I actually was, believe it or not.  
Not about COP or WC2022 I mean - my birthday.

## Good COP, Bad COP?
(No-one's *ever* used that before)

COP ended yesterday with triumphant scenes but I can't help but feel we've seen this all before.  
I try to live in hope that perhaps things really will change - but Yoda always said there is no try so I'll leave it up to you to decide if I'm 'do-ing' or 'do not-ing'.

## W(e don't) C(are) 2022

Yes that incrediblely well thought out title was a reference to the Qatar WC, which kicked off today.  
Another marker of corporate greed trampling over moral decency for when aliens come to establish the history of a long lost ancient civilasation known as humankind in thousands of years to come.  
Could well be 10 years at this rate though.

What unsettles me is not just  

- the awarding of the WC to a corrupt, homophobic nation intent on sportswashing its image,  
- or the conditions under which immigrant workers suffered and died so that the necessary infrastructure could be built,  
- or how the rights of LGBTQ+ people are being tossed aside to line Infantino's pockets (don't worry though he feels gay because he was once ginger),  

but also the blatent disregard for the very spectacle itself with footballers dropping out like flies. 

What, actually, is the point of the whole thing?  
(I have a slightly cynical answer which again, I'll leave to your imagination.)

What I found most bizarre though is the amount of press coverage that the last minute ban of beer inside stadiums recieved.  

Perhaps as someone who doesn't drink I'm poorly positioned to comment, but I hardly found that to be the breaking news story that some outlets reported it to be - although in truth I would like to read some official statement containing the mental gymnastics that is being performed in justifying its continued sale in corporate areas.

## So another politics thing happened

Jeremy Hunt also unveiled his Autumn Statement but I've not bothered to read it so it's hardly fair of me to comment on it.
I did also write before about the lunacy of allowing Truss and co. to have such a profound impact on the UK economy so if Jeremy Huny has indeed undone all of it then I suppose I should be happy about that.

## Happy Tim(es)

What I am happy about is my birthday, which was the 24th such commemoration of my entering the world, and which I must say was certainly up there amongst the greats.  
For this I owe a great deal of thanks to Rui Lan, who some how managed to message about 20 people she'd never met before to help me celebrate - most of whom she had to message in Japanese.
To be honest prior to that I never really felt like I had people whom I could call actual friends here.

The problem is every one is too damn nice!  
(Trust me to find a complaint about any and everything...)

But it makes it hard to tell when people are being nice to you because they want to become friends, or if they are doing so out of social politeness and actually would rather I left them alone.
That's a bit pot calling kettle coming from me though.

After the many things that we did together though, I did feel like I had a better idea of who I could really call a friend.  
But even moreso had a better idea of how amazing Rui Lan actually is, and how lucky I am that she not only tolerates such a moody git, but would go to such difficulty to organise something like that for one.

## A return to your normal ranting programme

Finally, Twitter was also bought on my birthday which I'm rather neutral about overall, and I'm sure the buyer wishes he could return.

Yes it is amusing watching Elon Musk speedrun any% a huge social network to the ground but similarly, he's chucking away <span>$</span>44 billion on 'freeing the bird' - when Pakistan suffered an estimated damages of <span>$</span>40 billion after floods that have set the backdrop to this year's edition of COP, and after the promise of giving Indonesia \$20 billion to transition away from coal was widely celebrated as a huge achivement.

I wonder how many things would have constituted a better investment of that \$44 billion, than stacking it all up, setting a blue bird atop of it, and setting in on fire for Bonfire night?
