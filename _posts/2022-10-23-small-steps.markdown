I finish my Ranking War, the UK PM resigns (again) and one of Bozo's Jokers gets engaged.

## Small Changes for Me

So my ランク戦 (Ranking War) finished on Monday.
On the whole it was markedly more successful than last time around (I got zero wins and my freefall was only halted by the withdrawal of an opponent due to injury).

Managed to pick up two wins in my group of four, both over players who I'd struggled against in the past so that was a good sign of progress, placing me in second place in the group.

Since the person who topped our group won against the bottom ranked player from the group above, I still had a chance to keep climbing provided I too beat the bottom ranked player from the group above.
Sadly despite taking the first game (the first time I'd ever taken a game off this player), I wasn't able to take another and lost 1-2.

Anyways now that that's over I can focus fully on (another) reconstruction of my swing.
I finally plucked up the courage to ask 清水さん (one of the coaches) about my overhead swing and he explained a few things that I could do differently.
I felt a bit bad since this perhaps took a lot longer than he might have expected given the language barrier but I think we got there in the end.

One of the two areas he told me to change was to switch to a style of footwork that encouraged greater balance.
I suppose right about now a more sage blogger than I would make some smooth comment about how this reflected a change that they could also make in their day-to-day life.  
But I am no such blogger so we move swiftly on.

## Large Changes for the UK

Liz Truss' reign as PM has finally ended after 45 days in office - not quite the new 'era' that I dubbed it in my previous post...

I find it incredible how badly it all went wrong for her, especially given that about two weeks was taken up entirely by the death of the Queen.
One of the only positives to have come out of this entire shambles was this image from [/u/Bumfuddlediddled](https://www.reddit.com/r/Championship/comments/y99azv/number_of_watford_managers_per_prime_minister/), displaying the number of Watford Managers per Prime Minister.

And lettuce never forget (sorry) that she was not in the end able to outlast the lettuce.

But beyond the jokes and silly stats, it really is incredible how much damage this government has done in such a short time to the UK and its people.
The constant U-turns, massive economic upheaval and even scandals that occurred in this short time is beyond belief.
And now there's even real talk of bringing Boris Johnson back, after everything that happened during his time.
It's absolutely shocking and the sooner the public have a real say with a general election, the better.  
No wonder Armando Ianucci said it would be impossible to bring back The Thick of It.

It's also 100 years of the BBC apparently, and this anniversary brought this video to light, where Guy Goma, a prospective interviewee for a job at the BBC, was mistaken for the technology journalist Guy *Kewney* to discuss [Apple Corps v Apple Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Corps_v_Apple_Computer).  
(Sadly he never got the job.)

## Massive Changes for Zac and Kirsty

Finally and most importantly, the first member of Bozo's Jokers (our LoL team from secondary school) got engaged recently!  

I hope that you and Kirsty have every happiness in your life together.
