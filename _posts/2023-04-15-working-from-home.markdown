I spent the week in Kyoto, and am beginning to pick up a new language.

---

Last week I was 'WFH' in Kyoto, and gotta say it seemed much more fun than last time we went, despite not really doing as much.
Might have been helped by the fact that the hotel we stayed at was actually quite nice, with this new kind of shower that had jets that sprayed water horizontally at your body - was a lot of fun!

Also there is a crazy amount of noodle based shops in Kyoto, I never realised before.
I think it's reinforced to me that I'm definite a rice guy than a noodle guy - definitely had huge cravings by the end.

That being said I think if I was going to pick somewhere else to live in Japan outside of Tokyo, I think it would be Kyoto (even over Osaka which is definitely the more fun place).
For some reason I just prefer the general vibes of the place.
Can't quite put my finger on it.

Also got to see some deer in Nara!
Rui Lan said that they bow to you if you bow to them, like Hippogriffs in Harry Potter.
I thought that there was no way that would be true, but actually, it really happens (sometimes).
That was right up there with the most Japan things I've seen here.
